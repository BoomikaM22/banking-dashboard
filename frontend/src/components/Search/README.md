Banking Service Search Component
A sleek, React-based search interface designed for banking applications. This component allows users to quickly filter through a list of banking services (like fund transfers, bill payments, and balance inquiries) with a modern, high-contrast dark theme.

Real-time Filtering: The list updates instantly as the user types, filtering through the services array by name.

Dynamic UI States: * Button Hover: The search button transitions from an outline to a solid fill.

Result Highlighting: Individual list items highlight on hover for better visual feedback.

Conditional Rendering: The results box only appears once the user starts typing.

Modern Aesthetics: Uses a deep navy and electric blue color palette (#38bdf8) inspired by modern fintech dashboards.

Empty State Handling: Displays a "No results found" message if the search query doesn't match any services.
